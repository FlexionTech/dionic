          <p>
            Dr Di Ashworth is the founder of DIONIC. She is a dedicated Social
            Worker with a diverse and rich background in disability support,
            counselling, education, and research. Di brings a holistic and
            deeply personal perspective to her work, shaped by both professional
            expertise and lived experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her professional journey includes working at the National Disability
            Insurance Agency (NDIA) as a National Disability Insurance Scheme
            (NDIS) Planner. In this role, she has gained valuable understanding
            and experience of the scheme’s support and funding landscape. She
            has worked at Vision Australia (VA), as coordinator of the Quality
            Living Support program. In this role, she worked with individuals

          <p>
            Driven by her passion to understand the human experience, her PhD
            explored young people's identity development. Dr Di Ashworth's
            commitment to innovation is further highlighted, as a person living
            with vision loss, participating as the first research participant in
            the Australian Bionic Eye trial.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, she continues to ensure digital spaces are accessible
