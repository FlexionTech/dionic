            Worker with a diverse and rich background in disability support,
            counselling, education, and research. Di brings a holistic and

            expertise and lived experience.
          </p>

            Her professional journey includes working at the National Disability
            Insurance Agency (NDIA) as a National Disability Insurance Scheme
            (NDIS) Planner. In this role, she has gained valuable understanding

            has worked at Vision Australia (VA), as coordinator of the Quality

            commitment to innovation is further highlighted, as a person living
            with vision loss, participating as the first research participant in
            the Australian Bionic Eye trial.
